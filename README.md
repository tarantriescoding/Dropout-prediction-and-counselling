📘 Dropout Prediction and Counselling System

The Dropout Prediction and Counselling System is an intelligent machine-learning–powered application designed to identify students at risk of dropping out and provide timely counselling support. Using academic, behavioural, demographic, and socio-economic factors, the system predicts dropout likelihood and offers actionable insights to institutions, teachers, and counsellors.

🔍 Key Features

Machine Learning Prediction
Utilizes trained models to accurately determine the probability of student dropout.

Real-time Analysis
Takes student-related inputs such as attendance, grades, participation, feedback, etc., and produces instant predictions.

Counselling Recommendation
Provides automated suggestions and intervention strategies tailored to the risk level.

Interactive Interface
A user-friendly web app built (Streamlit / Flask / Django — customize based on your project) to visualize predictions and insights.

Data-driven Insights
Helps institutions take informed decisions to reduce dropout rates and improve student retention.

🎯 Objective

To assist schools, colleges, and universities in early identification of at-risk students and provide timely counselling, thereby improving overall academic performance and reducing dropout rates.
