**🌟 Dropout Prediction and Counseling System** (Umeed Rise)

A complete ML-powered student risk analysis, explainability, and counseling support platform.

📘 Overview

The Dropout Prediction and Counseling System is an end-to-end machine learning application designed to help educational institutions identify students at risk of dropping out and provide timely, data-driven interventions.

Built with XGBoost, SHAP explainability, and an intuitive Streamlit UI, the system combines predictive accuracy with transparency—ensuring teachers, counselors, and administrators can trust and act on the insights.

This project also focuses on practical adoption by reducing the “black-box” barrier through clear visual explanations and automatic counseling recommendations.

**🚀 Key Features**

🔮 1. Dropout Risk Prediction (XGBoost)

Trains a robust model on student academic, attendance, and demographic data

Handles missing values, mixed data types, categorical encoding, and scaling

Supports both Simple mode (auto settings) and Advanced mode (customizable model parameters)

**🧠 2. Explainable AI with SHAP**

Global SHAP summary plots

Per-student explanations (feature contribution, waterfall plots)

Helps educators understand why the model predicts risk

**📊 3. Interactive Analytics Dashboard**

Risk distribution charts

Pie charts of risk levels

Confusion matrix and model evaluation metrics

Top high-risk students are sorted automatically

**🔍 4. Student Search**

Search by ID, name, roll number, or email

Instant risk report, SHAP explanation, and summary stats

Downloadable per-student report (CSV)

**🤝 5. Counseling & Peer Mentoring**

Auto-generated counseling suggestions for Low/Medium/High risk

Identifies potential peer mentors based on attendance and performance

Auto-matches mentors with high-risk students (demo)

**⚙️ 6. Smart Auto-Detection**

Detects target column, ID column, and numeric/categorical features

Detects attendance & marks columns for summaries

Works with messy or unstructured CSVs

**🏗️ Tech Stack**

Python

Streamlit (UI)

XGBoost (Model)

SHAP (Explainability)

Plotly / Matplotlib (Visualizations)

Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn

Joblib for model persistence

**🧪 How It Works**

1️⃣ Upload student dataset (CSV)
2️⃣ Auto-detection of relevant columns
3️⃣ Train model in one click
4️⃣ View dashboard, SHAP results, or search for a specific student
5️⃣ Get generated alerts and counseling suggestions
6️⃣ Export predictions or individual reports

**🎯 Purpose**

This system aims to support:

Schools & Universities

Teachers & Mentors

Counselors & Student Support Teams

Education Researchers & Policy Makers

By providing early warning signals and actionable support plans, the project helps reduce student dropout rates and promote timely interventions.
